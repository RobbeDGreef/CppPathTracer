# Raytracer
Somewhat simple ray tracer, or more specifically, path tracer. This tracer was built following the 
[ray tracer in one weekend book](https://raytracing.github.io/). It is not a word for word copy since
I diverted from the book and just used it for reference.

This is just a hobby project I wrote for fun but some of the code has come in handy for other projects
too (for example the BMP write code). So anyone that wants to use code from this project is welcome to
do so.
